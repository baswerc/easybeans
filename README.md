# EasyBeans

The EasyBeans library aims to make bridging your Java objects to JMX easy. It provides the following functionality:

* A wrapper to turn your Java objects into Dynamic MBeans. The functionality of the MBean can be specified with EasyBean annotations are through a convention based approach.
* A Java object to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/management/openmbean/OpenType.html">OpenType</a> converter to make complex objects your MBean object exposes (through attributes or operations) consumeable by JMX clients.
* A simplified mechanism for emitting JMX notifications.
* A centralized EasyBean repository for registering and unregistering your Java objects to the default JMX platform.
